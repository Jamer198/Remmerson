Information --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Remmerson.
Remmerson is a project that I have started just for funsies. It is meant to bring back the look and feel of old chat services, like MSN Messenger. Right now it is pretty bare bones, but I will work on making it better.
You are not able to send files at the moment, so don't look at the error codes and go, "Woah! How can I send files???" Because you can't. Those error codes are from earlier builds when I tried implementing it, but it was janky and barely worked, so I got rid of it. I'm keeping the error codes for when I try to reimplement it.

Troubleshooting --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your sounds aren't working, make sure there is a folder in the same directory as the client named "Sounds" and make sure the sounds are named appropriately.
"Change_Theme"
"Message_Notification"
"User_Join_Server"
"User_Leave_Server"

If you cannot connect to the server and it gives you error codes, the server might be down, or you have been banned.
If you cannot connect to the server and it doesn't give you error codes, the server is down and I will have to turn it back on.

If the client does not open, make sure icon.ico exists in the client's directory.
